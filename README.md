# Literal Aimbot
This mod is well... literally just aimbot, but it's a Northstar Client Mod.
There is only 1 exception, and that is that this mod is not finished fully yet, as the aimbot is only able to track horizontally. This means you will have to aim vertically yourself, however this is very easy to do.

Be warned : THIS MOD IS ACTUALLY AIMBOT AND WILL WORK!!!

## How to install
To install this mod you'll need to either have Northstar or Northstar setup for vanilla. I recommend using one of these to do that : 
https://github.com/Titanfall2-T/AutoMatchmakingMod
https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/NanohmProtogen/VanillaPlus/

To install it, simply extract the zip file, then drag the folder into either R2Northstar/mods or R2Titanfall/mods depending on whether you want it for vanilla, northstar, or both. 

### How to use

To use it, simply load into the game, open console with \` then type in console `la_enabled 1` and then `la_tb 1` if you want to use the Trigger Bot feature added in v1.4.0 (Highly recommended, it makes the mod truly OP)
Then load into a match, and just look at people, it's simple as that! If you don't have the trigger bot feature enabled, then you'll have to damage someone before the aimbot will start tracking them.

### What the ConVars do
Here's a list of the ConVars and what they do : 

`la_enabled` - can be either 0 or 1 and is whether the aimbot is enabled or not

`la_aim_rate` - this is how fast the aimbot script is updating the position of the view (recommended not to change unless you are having issues with the aimbot or want to experiment, but generally I'd recommend to keep it above 10 and below 1000)

`la_aim_speed` - this is how fast the aimbot script can drag your view (recommended not to change unless you are having issues with the aimbot, but keep it above 10 and below 500)

`la_tb` - can be either 0 or 1 and is whether the trigger bot is enabled or not

`la_ass_power` - when using the trigger bot, the mod will automatically tap fire every weapon you use and make it fully automatic as well. This convar is just the percentage of the original fire rate to use (You can lower it, but not raise it. 1.0 is 100% of the original fire rate and 0.5 is 50% of the original fire rate, and so on)
